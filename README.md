# ![Dummy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dummy-team/dummy/gh-pages/img/dummy.png)

## Solid foundations for modern development
_Sass, javascript & automation_

The purpose of the dummy is to provide a consistent file structure with a normalized code and a collection of helpers and resets ([_Components served separately_](https://github.com/dummy-team/dummy-toolkit)). It wraps [ITCSS](http://itcss.io/) principles with a powerful automation system.
